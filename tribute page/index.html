                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was born in Rameswaram on October 15, 1931, to a humble
family, studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades
as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
and was intimately involved in India's civilian space program and military missile
development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also
played a pivotal organizational, technical and political role in India's Pokhran-II
nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
It was the role he will probably be most remembered for -- a President who brought
Rashtrapati Bhavan to the people.... earning him the tribute of the “People's
President”.
Dr. Kalam's 79th birthday was recognised as World Student Day by the United
Nations. He has also received honorary Doctorates from 40 universities. The
Government of India has honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the
Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a
scientific advisor to the Government. In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian
honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and
modernisation of defence technology in India. In 2005, Switzerland declared 26 May
as "Science Day" to commemorate Kalam's visit to the country. In 2013, he was the
recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize
excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project."
It was an immense privilege that Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam accepted our invitation and
was present at Institute’s Golden Jubilee celebration during 2009.
He will be remembered for his engagement with the people - especially children -
even after his Presidency and the books that he wrote - India 2020 and, of course,
Ignited minds.
"If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun," APJ Abdul Kalam had said in one
of his inspirational speeches. He certainly did.
Today that sun has set.
The death of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is an irrecoverable loss to the Country
